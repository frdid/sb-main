I don’t know how file explorer works, but for dataview is precisely a file name issue… because in case all your file.name are strings. It doesn’t read the values as a numbers, that’s why 10... is listed firstly than 2..., i.e., names are compared alphabetically, character to character. If you use always this structure - “number+dot+title” I suggest something like this: `SORT number(split(file.name, "\.")[0]) ASC`
```
list
FROM "03-Main Box"
SORT number(split(file.name, "\-")[0]) ASC
```
